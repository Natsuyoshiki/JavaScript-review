  Main idea of javascript:
   1.Save the data 
   2.Generate the html 
   3.Make it interactive

   in /scripts/amazon.js first save the data, means matching the HTML of the page but in JS. This is called a data structure. Usually uses a mix of array and objects (lists and values).

   To generate the HTML, we can loop through the array
      products.forEach((product) => {const html = `html code`});

      then inside it , we can make slightly different changes by changing some spots using the array/objects we made before. In the code for ex change the img src="source" source link with
      img src="${product.image}"
      same for name, rating etc...

      then combine the html together and 
      put it on the web page (using the DOM)

      select the container of the products earlier with the class and DOM 
      document.querySelector('.js-products-grid').innerHTML = productsHTML;

      then we can delete the arrays/values we selected from the HTML since its now in the javascript (productsHTML) file.
      now we can add new data just by adding values into the JS product list (array/objects) and the loop will handle the html for us

      btw the page will show the price like this 10,9 instead of 10.90 because
      price cents = 1090
      1090/100 = 10.9
      Numbers got a special method to fix this (x / 100).toFixed(2)
      .toFixed will convert a number into a string and we can tell him how many decimals we want

      How to know which product to add (into cart)?
        <B> Data attribute </B>
      is just another html attribute
      allows us to attach any information to an element
         data-product-name="${product.name}"
        syntax for a data attribute, name on the left, value on the right
        have to start with data- then give it any name but make sure to separate with a - (kebab case)

        dataset gives us all the data attributes attached to the element, so able to get the product name ex: 
        const productName = button.dataset.productName; 
        data name is converted from kebabcase to camel case

        not good to use product name to find item in cart, cuz we might have items with same name.
        to fix this:
        give each product an id
        id should be unique

        data-product-id="${product.id} instead

        14 - modules
        Having multiples script files into 1 html can cause errors due to naming conflicts happening cuz we declared a variable with same name in different js files. That's the issue with script tags linked one at a time. 
        Can fix that with a feature of JS called Modules, it contains a variable INSIDE a file.

        <b>Create a module.</b>
        1. Create a file 
        2. Don't load the file with script tag

        <b>Get a variable out of a file</b>
        1.Add type="module" attribute   <!-- <script type="module" src="scripts/amazon.js"></script> -->
        2.Export <!-- export const cart = []; gets the var outside of cart.js--> 
        3.Import <!-- import {cart} from '../data/cart.js' --> import the var inside this file '..' is to get out of this folder, we need to locate the file of the var
        Cam also rename the var name when importing import {cart as myCart} from '../data/cart.js';

        type="module" attribute 
        Let's this file get variables out of other files.

        Rules for modules:
        1. put all imports at top of the files
        2. we need to open with live server
